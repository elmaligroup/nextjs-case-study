# Step 1 - About the Case Study

In this case study, we will be creating a CRUD interface.

### What is CRUD?

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These are abbreviated functions. For example, let's consider a page that lists users. On this page:

- When we list users, we are performing a "Read" operation.
- When we add a new user, we are performing a "Create" operation.
- When we edit the information of an existing user, we are performing an "Update" operation.
- When we delete a user, we are performing a "Delete" operation.

We expect the design to be the same or similar to the one provided. The design should be responsive and work seamlessly across different browsers. You can access the Figma designs through the following [link](#).
